# Crafting Interpreters Implementation

This repository contains my implementation of the interpreter from the book *Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom. The project follows the Lox language as described in the book and includes both the tree-walk interpreter (jlox) and the bytecode virtual machine (clox).
